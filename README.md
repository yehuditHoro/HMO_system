The Health Fund Member Management System is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing members of a health fund. 
The system allows users to view a list of all members entered into the system manually. 
Upon selecting a member, the system displays their card, showing various details such as COVID-19 vaccination dates, illness dates (if applicable), and recovery dates. Users can easily navigate through the list of members and access specific member information with ease. 
The system aims to streamline the process of managing health fund members and ensure that relevant information is readily accessible.
